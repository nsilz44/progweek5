    <div class="col-sm-4">Bioinformatics as a field developed mainly due to the abundant amount of genomic data that needed to be stored, managed and analysed through databases. Computer science in this field enables the causes of diseases to be explored at a molecular level. </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">Generally, the aim of bioinformatics is to explain biological process and malfunctions in these processes which can lead to disease. Following this it also attempts to develop new approaches towards drug discovery that may treat these conditions by making use of computer techniques such as data mining and machine learing.These techniques ensures that data can be analysed and interpretted quicker and as a result, drug discovery becomes a cheaper and faster process.</div>

Every disease has a genetic component and environmental stress can cause changes in the genome in cases such as cancers, heart disease and diabetes. Analysis of the human genome means we can search for genes directly associated with different diseases and begin to understand the molecular basis of diseases more clearly.</td>

These drugs are more specific and therefore have fewer side effects than today's medicines.</td>
