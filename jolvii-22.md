  # Grade: Excellent

# 2.Consistency and quality of visual presentation

    - page is well laid out, very neat
    - nav bar is well-built
    - small quip: perhaps a line break in the middle of the first paragraph (between "individuals" and "unfortunately"), for easier & neater reading
    - very small quip: perhaps the github profile page and the "visit their website" link could be loaded on a new tab, saves reloading back to the current page
    - small quip: formatting is not fully optimized when using mobile browsers
        - images overlap
        - nav bar is not in place
        - author box doesn't scale well
    Nonetheless, main text content is still neatly formatted. Overall, well done.
